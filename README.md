### üöÄ Featured Project: [KIBewerbungsSchreiben](https://kibewerbungsschreiben.de/) üìÑ‚ú®

This is a **live MicroSaaS application** I conceived, designed, and built from the ground up to help users craft effective cover letters for the German job market using AI.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Architecture:** Full-Stack application with a React/TypeScript frontend and a Node.js/TypeScript backend.
*   **Frontend:** Built with **React** and **TypeScript**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**. Includes a rich text editor (**Tiptap**) for editing generated content. State management handled by **Zustand**.
*   **Backend:** Powered by **Node.js** and **TypeScript**, utilizing **Vite** for the build process. Uses **Prisma ORM** for database interactions (schema management, migrations, type-safe queries). Input validation with **Zod**. Logging managed by **Pino**.
*   **AI Integration:** Leverages the **Vercel AI SDK (@ai-sdk)** to seamlessly integrate and stream responses from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) like **OpenAI (GPT models), Google (Gemini), Anthropic (Claude),** etc., providing flexibility and robustness. Focus on effective prompt engineering for high-quality text generation and editing features (summarize, detail, change tone).
*   **Services & Deployment:** Integrates **Stripe API** for secure user authentication and subscription payments. Uses privacy-friendly analytics (**Plausible/Umami**). Deployed on modern cloud platforms. *(Example: Vercel/Netlify/Fly.io/Render)*
*   **(Repo Status:** Currently hosted in a private repository.)

_(This project demonstrates my ability to build a complete, functional web application using modern technologies and integrate complex third-party APIs like AI models and payment gateways.)_
